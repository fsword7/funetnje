This directory contains the software we use at UofToronto to transform the
various BITNET mailer tables to the format used in the bitnet.transport file.

XMAILER.NAMES	is the familiar XMAILER NAMES file
CADOMAIN.NAMES	is the Canadian version of the DOMAIN NAMES file
toronto.names	describes the campus-specific information

These three are merged to produce a "bitnet.transport" file.

I haven't tried to make this code more generic, because it is highly likely
you will have to do something to customize it to your own site.  Instead here
is a model of a working setup.  The XMAILER.NAMES file included here is
a random subset of the real thing, to save space.
