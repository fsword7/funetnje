History of the FUNET-NJE package
********************************

   *"Credit where the credit is due to"*

   Original version of this software is known as *HUJI-NJE*, which is
VAX-VMS software for implementing BITNET-II, and several BISYNC modes
of the NJE network.  It was made at the *Hebrew University of
Jerusalem* (HUJI), by Mr. *Yehavi Bourvine* over the years 1988-1993.

   Sometime around 1990-1991 FUNET archive server was decided to
connect to the EARN, and the best (= free in source form) technology
for it turned to be HUJI-NJE.

   The original HUJI-NJE is monsterous monolithic program which has
built-in processing of incoming email, and translation of files (in and
out) in between ASCII and EBCDIC.

   At first Matti Aarnio <mea@nic.funet.fi> did minor porting of the
program to get it to work on a Sun4/630 server (nic.funet.fi), which
did surface several problems in between VAX, and other architectures.

   Latter the HUJI-people lost their interest on the system, and when
no radical improvements were on sight, begun the more serious porting
of the system to Sun4 machine.

   Then on Summer-93 came a contact from Mr. Gerald Hanusch
<K000165@ALIJKU65>, who wanted to improve the then-present version of
FUNET-NJE to be more complete in respect of its emulation of the RSCS
for replacing their aging VM/XA CMS machine - they had administrative
systems on another MVS machine, and communication to it was to be
preserved, although the VM/XA CMS machine was turned off.

   Over the months the system improved, and it was considered that all
the necessary major parts of the NJE-emulator were functional on
January-94.

   Up until then the software developement was on "fun to do" basis,
and beside the actual job of the parties involved.

   See previous chapter about *Support* for more about the supported
version.

Introduction to NJE-networking
******************************

   Traditionally NJE-networking happens (did happen) in between two IBM
mainframes via BISYNC cable on 4800/9600 bps speed.

   Used protocols do vary, but most widely used ones have multiple
interleaved streams etc. in them, and they keep a tab on line condition
by timeouting, if acknowledgements don't appear quick enough.  The
protocols also have a sort of CRCs in them for every "packet" they send
over the wire.

   Things that are possible with NJE-network are:
*Unsolicited file transfer*
     Sending files to the recipients without them being aware of files
     coming to them, nor in fact asking any authorization prior sending
     it to them.

     Especially this contradicts the way how the FTP works.

     This happens in *Store-and-Forward*-manner, that is, when the file
     is sent over one link, responsibility for it is transferred to the
     next node, and link-sender can delete it from its own spool.

*Remote Job Entry*
     Sending batch-jobs to remote machine for execution, especially to
     MVS systems.

*Nodal Messaging*
     Sending short (max 120 chars) lines of messages to recipients at
     other nodes.

   With these basic facilities it is possible to build extended
services, like:
*
     Remote printing

*
     Email

*
     File transfer

*
     Remote Job Execution (Batch processing)

*
     Interactive discussion one line at the time via NMR-messages

*
     Interactive control of servers accepting NMR-messages

   This networking mechanism allows to have simple phone-line quality
links to be used to transport huge amounts of data over long distances.
It may be somewhat slow at the times, but it works...

   An entry-level BITNET connectivity requires capability to communicate
via synchronous BISYNC interface, although these days BITNET-II
technology has largely surplanted it.  See on next chapter.

   There exists even ASYNC NJE, although that is more like experimental
kludge for hackers, than serious production tool. (Not supported by the
FUNET-NJE.)

   Names in the BITNET  are at most 8 characters long.  This applies
both to the users, and the machines (*nodes*).

   Routing in the BITNET requires every machine to know every other, and
therefore there exists fairly large bureaucracy for keeping the linkage
information up to date.

   Full routing updates are done in semi-monthly manner, which updates
can usually be incorporated into the system with minimal fuzz, or in
case of FUNET-NJE, automatically.

   There are email-gateways in between the BITNET, and the rest of the
world.  Email is transported inside the BITNET with five methods:
*defrt1*
     Target system has no mailer, all email must be sent to the users
     directly.  Normally a mail-file is sent in PUNCH-80 format.

*bsmtp3*
     Target system has a mailer, which can receive Batch-SMTP-file
     containing the email.  Format of the file is PUNCH-80.

*bsmtp3rfc*
     Like *bsmtp3*, but addresses in RFC-822 format instead of BITNET
     node style.

*bsmtp3nd*
     Target system has a mailer, which can receive Batch-SMTP-file
     containing the email.  Format of the file can be PUNCH-80, or
     NETDATA.  In case the email contains longer lines, than 80
     characters, this is recommended method, if receiver system can
     accept it.

*bsmtp3ndrfc*
     Like *bsmtp3nd*, but addresses in RFC-822 format instead of BITNET
     node style.

   To familiarize him-/herself with NJE-networking,  the reader should
also have access to the IBM  manual `*Network Job Entry Formats and
Protocols for System/370 Program Products*', *GG22-9373-02* or
*SC23-0070-01* (or later).

Structure of Second Generation BITNET on virtual links
******************************************************

   BITNET was a traditional wires+modems network, until the NSF-net
began to grow in late 1980's.

   When it became evident, that having separate wires for BITNET, and
for other networking activities (TCP/IP, NSF-net) is asking to keep old
separate lines in existance with new high-speed Internet, multiple
solutions were sought after for replacing physical wires with virtual
ones.

   In 1986-1989 Ira Fuchs, Peter Olenick et.al. (Princeton University)
developed so called BITNET-II protocol, with which it became possible
to replace dedicated physical wires with virtual TCP/IP connections
over the Internet.

   The protocol, and its reference implementation are described on
`BRFC0002 TEXT' available at least from  ftp.funet.fi:
       ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/doc/netinfo/CREN/brfc0002.text
   via anonymous FTP.

   Soon after, (in 1990), Lee Varian, Peter Olenick, and Michael Gettes
(all from Princeton University) made a BITNET restructuring proposal in
which they divided fine-grained threaded mesh of the former BITNET into
9 regions.

   From their  `bit2plan.proposal':
                                                       February 1, 1990
                                             Revised September 21, 1990

           Proposal to Restructure the  Network Supporting BITNET

     Historically the  physical and  logical networks  supporting
BITNET have   been structured on leased  communications lines
connecting member sites.   New sites  connect to the network  based
upon  an  existing BITNET  member's  willingness  and  ability to
support the request for connection.   The cost of  the leased
communications line, which is paid for by the new  BITNET  site,  is
also a  consideration  in choosing  which  existing BITNET sites are
possible connection points.   The  cost of  the communications line
may be different  based on  factors of distance and tariff
considerations.   This method  of connecting new sites has worked quite
well,  but the lack  of  a   formal  structure  for   the  network   is
creating  limitations  which  impair  the  efficiency  and  growth  of
BITNET.  The lack of a structure increases the complexity of  routing
table  generation and  hampers efforts  to implement  network
management tools.    The ability  to create  BITNET  links  by  using
the  national  and  regional  IP  networks  increases the confusion
over where BITNET connections should  be made.

     The idea of reorganizing BITNET into a more formal structure  has
been discussed for a number  of years,  but the costs of  the
additional leased lines needed  to implement such a plan  made the
project economically infeasible.   Now,  BITNET has  the ability to use
the national and regional IP networks;  a  plan to restructure BITNET
by  using the IP networks appears  to be  cost effective and
implementable.   This  plan could  also be implemented using private
communications facilities  and IP routers instead  of using  the
national  and regional  networks.   The costs of  an  implementation
using a private  IP network would need to be carefully considered.

                           Restructuring Proposal

     The   restructuring    is   based   on   the    concept   of
'regionalization',   the  separation  of  the  network  into
geographic areas  or regions.   Each  region would  have two  'core'
sites.    Each  core site  would  have  RSCS-over-IP  connections to
every other core site.   The core sites would  form a 'backbone'.
The national and regional  IP networks  are the physical  facilities
that would be used  by the core  sites  to   form  the   BITNET
backbone.     By  generating  appropriate BITNET routing tables,  the
number of nodes and  the amount of traffic handled by  the core sites
for a given  region can be  statically balanced.   Within a  region,
the  core sites could  connect to a number  of 'mid-level' sites,
again by use  of RSCS-over-IP.   This type  of structure has  the
ability to provide an alternate  path into a region if a  core site
were  out of service.   The member  sites or 'end'  sites within a
region could  connect to the mid-level sites.   Traditional leased line
connections may  exist at any level  within the  structure but  these
types  of connections  will  continue to  have limitations.    That is,
 if a  host with  traditional leased lines is down, no other path may
exist to  the sites supported by that leased line.  ...

                       Benefits of the restructuring

     The purpose of the regionalization  is to impose a structure  on
the  logical network supporting BITNET.    This structure  will  reduce
the  burden  on   the  current  hub  sites  by  decreasing  the number
of files  which  must transit  these  sites.  Overall network service
will be improved because the  number of 'hops'  a file must take to
reach its destination  will be reduced or be no  greater than in the
current BITNET  topology.   The impact  on BITNET when a key  BITNET
node or  Internet connectivity fails  will be reduced because  of the
increased number of connections between core sites.   As the
intra-regional mid-level structure develops,  the ability of  the  core
sites to dynamically  reroute  traffic  around  a  disabled  core node
will provide  improved network  access.   The three level (core,
mid-level, end site) structure of the  region  can be  expanded to
include  additional levels  and  paths as  needed within the  region,
thereby  providing for  dynamic rerouting within a region as well.

Installation of FUNET-NJE package
*********************************

   Installation of this package is fairly straight-forward by editing
proper parts from to be activated from the `Makefile', and editing
sample configuration files for your local machine.

   This system has two hard-wired files, which can be overridden by
editing `site_consts.h'-file, or defined in `Makefile':
*/etc/funetnje.cf*
     Main configuration file telling where rest of the system resides

*/etc/funetnje.pid*
     The "pid file" giving easy pointer to the running emulator program

   Via `/etc/funetnje.cf', and its extensions (`msg-exit.cf',
`file-exit.cf') it is possible to define outgoing, and incoming spool
directories, et.al.  Only notable detail is that all those directories
*must* reside on same disk partition, as files are moved from within
emulator spool to user spool with *link(2)*-, and *unlink(2)*-system
calls. (Or  *rename(2)*, if it exists.)

   For inter-module access control this software uses one UNIX group,
which is used to *set-gid* some programs, and which is needed for
system administrators so that they can run the control program without
a need to become super-users, and also without a need to set-gid the
control-panel (`ucp').

   Things to decide:
   * Name and number of the `bitnet' programs group (into your
     `/etc/group').  The `Makefile' has variable NJEGRP for it.

   * Directories for your BITNET transmission spool, and user spool.
     *Important: those must be on same partition!*

     Example configurations have them as: `/var/spool/bitnet'
     (*QUEUEDIR*), and  `/var/spool/bitspool'  (*USERSPOOL*).

   * Location of various programs, `Makefile' has variables: MANDIR,
     LIBDIR, BINDIR, and ETCDIR.

   Choosing proper defines for the compile of the software, especially
your platform dependent pre-processor constants:
*-D_POSIX_SOURCE*
     Use on true `POSIX.1' systems

*-DHAS_PUTENV*
     If your system has SysV-like  `putenv(3)' to set environment
     variable.  When this is not defined, a BSD-like `setenv(3)' is
     assumed

*-DHAS_LSTAT*
     Use when your system has  `lstat(2)' in addition to the usual
     `stat(2)'

*-DUSE_SOCKOPT*
     Use when your system has a working  `setsockopt(2)' for
     `SO_RCVBUF', and `SO_SNDBUF'.  Most systems do!  This is a
     performace option, which *might* help on busy systems

*-DNBCONNECT*
     The system can do a `connect(2)' on a socket, which has been
     flagged as non-blocking.  Without this connection to a system
     which is unreachable would cause system to hang for synchronous
     timeout...

*-DCONFIG_FILE=...*
     Override `consts.h' definition of system config file name

*-DPID_FILE=...*
     Override `consts.h' definition of emulator process-id file name

**A set of IPC methods, choose one!**
*-DCOMMAND_MAILBOX_FIFO*
     Uses named pipe (`mkfifo(2)') for an emulator vs. user programs
     IPC channel.  Fifo path is taken from `/etc/funetnje.cf'
     CMDMAILBOX entry

*(-DFIFO_0_READ)*
     A subitem on *-DCOMMAND_MAILBOX_FIFO* - Do a `close(2)'/`open(2)'
     pair on a FIFO, when read from it returns 0.  Was needed for Linux
     0.99pl13.

*-DCOMMAND_MAILBOX_SOCKET*
     Uses `AF_UNIX', `SOCK_STREAM' for the IPC channel.  Socket path is
     taken from `/etc/funetnje.cf' CMDMAILBOX entry

*-DCOMMAND_MAILBOX_UDP*
     Uses `AF_INET', `SOCK_DGRAM' for the IPC channel.  Socket IP
     address is taken from `/etc/funetnje.cf' CMDMAILBOX entry
     (numeric), and it naturally must be on same machine, as the
     emulator runs.  This is only choise for cluster nodes

*-DBSD_SIGCHLDS*
     Uses `BSD'-style `SIGCLD/SIGCHLD' handling where an signal trapper
     program is required to process the exited child information.  On
     `SysV'-systems it is safe (it seems) to just ignore `SIGCLD' and
     that way to get rid of the zombied child.

**Some compiler switches:**
*-fno-builtin*
     A GNU-CC option telling it, that builtin accelerated operations
     should not be used. (Alignment may cause problems on some cases!)
     However we have a fairly high confidence that we have eliminated
     every case, where inlining a `memcpy(3)' could cause problems.
     Try without it!  (Possible problems manifest themselves as
     coredrops due to SIGBUS, as  some memory accesses may become
     unaligned..)

**Some more esoteric tricks:**
*-DDEBUG*
     If you really want to see what goes on...  The amount of DEBUG-code
     is decreasing all the time, and frankly we haven't compiled the
     code with `-DDEBUG' for last 100 or so versions, we have just added
     `logger()'-calls into it at places needing it, and adjusted
     LOGLEVEL to get them into LOGFILE, and then commented or removed
     those loggers out again..

*-DUSE_ZMAILER -I/usr/local/include*
     For `mailify.c' - for tight integration with Zmailer MTA.

*-DUSE_OWN_PROTOS*
     If the "prototypes.h" -function prototypes for various things can
     for your system, and your system does not have ANSI-headers of its
     own, then use this

   Several pre-tested compiler setups are also available in the
`Makefile'.

   Shows a listing of user's BITNET spool - the `reader'.

     ...

   Synopsis: `  qrdr [ -u user ] [ -n ] [ -l ] [ dirpaths, filepaths ]'

   *qrdr* gives users a tool to see what they have in their incoming
BITNET spool queues.  Depending on file protections, it also lets
others to see what user XYZ has in his/her queue, or ANY directory
possibly containing BITNET spool files, or just any specified files...

   When `-u user' has not been used, the default behaviour of *qrdr* is
to find out who user is making query by asking `whoami', eg. getting
value of LOGNAME environment variable.  (On SysV this is USER variable.)
If the environment doesn't give answer, `/etc/passwd'-file is consulted
with effective uid.

   Spool directory is determined using same mechanism as in *funetnje*
main program.  Sample configuration of file procesing exits gives
directory `/usr/spool/bitspool'  in  which UPPERCASE userids (or
pseudoids - MAILER is one such) are  `user' specific subdirectories
containing individual spooled files.

   Option `-l' gives file paths to spool files, and some heuristics of
file contents  for *rdrlist(1)* program.  For program-parsing usage,
the `-l' option uses singular tabulator to separate output fields.

   For the `-l' option, recognized data types are: NETDATA, VMSDUMP,
CARD (Cornell CARD), and PUNCH when none of the previous ones match to
input punch records.  For three PRINT formats there  are: PRINT
(Machine Carriage Control), PASA (ANSI Carriage Control), and PCPDS for
rare 3rd alternative.

Receive files from spool: `receive'
===================================

   With `receive(1)' user can receive files from the spool with a
*spoolid* (a decimal number in range of 1 to 9900), a filename in the
user's spool directory, or (relative) path to a file.

     Synopsis:
         receive [-n] [-a|-b] [-asa|-rawpun|-bitraw|-bcat]  [-d]
                 [-u username ] [-o outpath ] {filepath|spoolid}

   Options are as follows:
*-n*
     Don't delete the spool file, when processing completes
     successfully.

*-a*
     Do forced translate of the file contents from EBCDIC to ASCII.
     (Despite of the spool file's class.)

*-b*
     Consider the file to be binary, only receive it, don't translate.

*-d*
     Debug outputs of the NJE spool file

*-asa*
     Affects PRINT files which contain MCC carriage control codes (see
     bitspool(5)) by trsnlating them to FORTRAN-style carriage control.

*-rawpun*
     Outputs the file contents (usually 80 chars per record PUNCH
     records) as is without adding anything, nor translating it.

*-bitraw*
     ????

*-bcat*
     Output non-translated records in format:
          <char of reclen> <chars of record>

*-u username*
     Look into username's spool directory, instead of who invokes the
     command.

*-o outpath*
     Define output file, `-' denotes STDOUT.

   Input files can be designated either with numeric spoolid, or
path(s) to the file(s).

File sending with `sendfile/print/punch/submit'
===============================================

   This program quintet is actually one binary with four invocation
names.  It behaves slightly differently with each name:
*sendfile*
     Generates *SYSOUT* *PUNCH* file containing *NETDATA* encoded
     contents of the original file, and submits it to transmission to a
     remote system.

*print*
     Generates *SYSOUT* *PRINT* file, and submits it to transmission to
     a remote system.

*punch*
     Generates *SYSOUT* *PUNCH* file, and submits it to transmission to
     a remote system.

*submit*
     Generates *SYSIN* batch job spool file, and submits it to
     transmission to a remote batch facility for further processing.

   The first format sends commands to designated node.  Using the
option `-c' (or `-command') is unnecessary, unless the target node is
wanted to be without the `@'-sign on the command line.

   The second format sends interactive (*NMR*) messages to the
recipient  *user@node*.  The maximum size of the NMR message is 120
characters per line.  Unlike for the files, the network will not
guarantee, that the NMR message will reach the destination, however it
does a "best effort" attempt at it.

   When no command string, or message text is included at the command
line, the input is taken from the *STDIN*.  If the input comes from
somewhere else than TTY, prompting is suppressed, like for example when
some command output is piped to `send'.

   When *STDIN* is used, message entering ends with the end-of-file
condition (Often created with `ctrl-D' from the keyboard.)

`bmail' - `sendfile' with a twist to send BSMTP email
=====================================================

   A special form of `sendfile' to send email-files to remote systems -
to a MTA at there, or (gasp), direct to the user, if no MTA exists at
the node...
       bmail [-u origuser] [-v] [-tag RSCS-TAG]
             [-nd Gateway-Address | -b(smtp) Gateway-address]
             FromUser@FromNode ToUser@ToNode [ToUser@ToNode...]

   Options are as follows:
*-u origuser*
     Defines the originating user, e.g. local *MAILER*...  Only
     *super-user* can use this option.

*-v*
     Request BSMTP `VERB ON' to be injected.  Sometimes usefull, when
     debugging some IBM CMS mailers.

*-tag RSCS-TAG*
     Optional RSCS-TAG string to be passed to the transporter, usually
     not needed.

*-nd Gateway-address*
     Send the email in NETDATA format - implies also BSMTP.

*-b(smtp) Gateway-address*
     Make the file contents to be BSMTP - that is, Batch SMTP.  Without
     NETDATA the width limit is 80 chars.

   The message content (along with its RFC-822 headers) is taken from
*STDIN*.

`mailify' - incoming mail-file processing
=========================================

   Normal use for `mailify' is to invoke it from incoming file
processing (see `file-exit.cf'):
       .../mailify /var/spool/.../NJEFILE
   There are actually two versions of `mailify', one which is script
(`mailify.sh'), and newer C-program,  which superceeds the old script.

   The `mailify' analyzes the incoming NJE-spool-file, and makes the
necessary parsing/transformation of it into RFC-822 format, and feeds
it to the system mailer.

   In the C-program there is support for `Zmailer''s mail(3) -library,
which thus can bypass more generic use of `/usr/lib/sendmail' as a
feeder to the system mailer.

   These incoming mail processors are at their best, when they receive
BSMTP in NETDATA file.

   This utility parses `BITEARN.NODES'-file, and from it all the
`*:type.NJE*' entries are checked up for possible `*:servers1.*'-entry,
which defines mailer.

   If no `*:servers1.*' is defined, default `*defrt1*' is used,
othervice some smarter version is chosen.

Interfacing Zmailer/smail/sendmail with FUNET-NJE
*************************************************

   Here are some instructions on how to interface various MTA-systems
into the *FUNET-NJE* package.

   There is a separate program (*mailify*) responsible for incoming
email processing, these are routers, and senders of BITNET email
(*bmail*), and there is route database generator for generating the
necessary  *nodename->route*  mapping (*namesfilter*).

* Menu:

* Zmailer::     Interfacing Toronto/FUNET Zmailer
* smail::       Interfacing smail3.0
* sendmail::    Interfacing BSD sendmail


File: funetnje.info,  Node: Zmailer,  Next: smail,  Up: Interfacing mailer

Interfacing Toronto/FUNET Zmailer with FUNET-NJE
================================================

   Doing this interface was easy due to vast amounts of easy to
understand configurability of the *Zmailer*(1) system.

   Depending on if the system is to be a smart-mailer, or not,
Zmailer's `router.cf' shall contain transport preference definition:
     # The transport preference order
     protocols='routes smtp usenet bitnet'
   which instructs it to include those four protocols into the
route-analysis. The protocols are attempted in given order!  Host
BITNET name must be defined in `/etc/name.bitnet' for Zmailer's
BITNET-protocol.

   If it is desirable *not to* have smart BITNET routing at the system,
it is possible to use lazy-routing of all "*.BITNET"-addresses into one
system somewhere else with following definition in `/etc/mail.conf':
     ...
     # rrouter.cf uses these..  Uncomment for use
     # : ${BITNETACTION:="bsmtp3nd mailer@searn"}
     # : ${BITNETACTION:="smtp figbox.funet.fi"}
   the first  one uses special delivery via BITNET facilities to
MAILER@SEARN, the second uses ordinary SMTP.

   BITNET email routing database (`$MAILVAR/db/routes.bitnet') contains
entries like:
     academic         bsmtp3!mailer!academic
     acmvm            bsmtp3!mailer!acmvm
     acusd            defrt1!acusd
     ...
     searn            bsmtp3nd!mailer!searn
     ...
   which essentially mean:
*academic*
     Use *bsmtp3*-channel, and send it to *mailer@academic*

*acusd*
     Use *defrt1*-channel, and send mail do *$user@acusd*

*searn*
     Use *bsmtp3nd*-channel (bsmtp3 in NETDATA instead of PUNCH), and
     send it to *mailer@searn*

   That email routing database is built from `BITEARN NODES'-file by
use of `namesfilter' -program:
     # ./namesfilter -zmailer < bitearn.nodes | sort > routes.bitnet
   Unlike the original Toronto `namesfilter'-package, this does not
take `BITEARN DOMAINS', or `XMAILER NAMES'.

   Channels are defined in `$MAILSHARE/scheduler.cf', in which these
five are defined as:
     ...
     defrt1/*
             command="sm -c $channel defrt1"
     bsmtp3/*
             command="sm -c $channel bsmtp3"
     bsmtp3rfc/*
             command="sm -c $channel bsmtp3rfc"
     bsmtp3nd/*
             command="sm -c $channel bsmtp3nd"
     bsmtp3ndrfc/*
             command="sm -c $channel bsmtp3ndrfc"
   Meaning they all are run via `sendmail-compatible transporter'.

   Configuration of the `sendmail-compatible transporter' at
`$MAILSHARE/sm.conf' contains these five entries for the BITNET:
     ...
     #
     # bitnet stuff F=hu not set
     #
     bsmtp3      snmSX /usr/local/lib/nje/bmail bmail -b $h -u MAILER $g $u
     bsmtp3rfc   snmSX /usr/local/lib/nje/bmail bmail -b $h -u MAILER $g $u
     bsmtp3nd    snmSX /usr/local/lib/nje/bmail bmail -nd $h -u MAILER $g $u
     bsmtp3ndrfc snmSX /usr/local/lib/nje/bmail bmail -nd $h -u MAILER $g $u
     defrt1      snS   /usr/local/lib/nje/bmail bmail $g $u

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Zmailer is a mailer running in two modes with multiple programs
doing their parts; `router' (1 to many) doing email address routing,
`scheduler' running transport channels, like `smtp', `mailbox' (local
delivery), etc.  There are also incoming channel programs `smtpserver',
and compability interface `/usr/lib/sendmail'.

   The Zmailer is available from
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/unix/mail/zmailer/zmailer-*vers*-*datecode*.tar.gz,
via anonymous FTP.

Interfacing Smail3.0 with FUNET-NJE
===================================

   In order to get SMAIL3.1.28 working with the FUNET-NJE emulator,
following steps are necessary:

  1. Copy the BSMTP3, BSMTP3ND and DEFRT1 BASH scripts to your
     SMAIL-LIBDIR, e.g. `/usr/local/lib/smail/'

  2. Edit these 3 Scripts to fit your nje emulator installation, mainly
     the path to the `bmail' program coming with the emulator needs to
     be set properly.

  3. If you don't use a `routers' and `transports' file till now,
     because the compiled in defaults of SMAIL fit your needs, make a
     copy of these files to the SMAIL-LIBDIR.  The source distribution
     of SMAIL comes with generic samples, which reflect the compiled-in
     configuration.

  4. Make an entry to `routers' file like below. Commonly between the
     entry which defines the `path' router and the `uucp-neighbors'
     router with the following lines

          bitnet: driver=pathalias,
                  method=bitmethods;
                  file=bitearn,
                  proto=bsearch,
                  -optional,
                  -required,
                  domain=bitnet,

     The position of the entries within `routers' file is significant.
     The decision, which path is taken, depends mainly on this position.
     Please consult the SMAIL doc, resp. man 5 smail for more info on
     this.

  5. Make a directory `methods' within SMAIL-LIBDIR.  Copy the supplied
     `bitmethods' file into there.

     Edit or generate a bitnet mailers routing table, and copy it to
     SMAIL-LIBDIR.  It can be built from `BITEARN NODES'-file by use of
     `namesfilter'-program:
          # ./namesfilter -smail < bitearn.nodes | sort > routes.bitnet

     The table has the common pathalias format with following entries:
             destdomain   transportmethod!mailername!nodename!%s

     where *destdomain* is the domain within bitnet, *transportmethod*
     is either bsmtp3, bsmtp3nd or defrt1, *mailername* is the name of
     the remote mailer userid which receives email from bitnet, and
     *nodename* is the bitnet node running the mailer

     The `*%s* behind the *nodename* is not needed for our purposes,
     but is necessary to pass the syntax check. The meaning of the 3
     transport methods is described in `bmail(8)' utility.

  6. Edit the `transports' file in SMAIL-LIBDIR by adding the entries
     bstmp3, bsmtp3nd, and defrt1.  A sample is provided with the nje
     emulator package.

  7. Add to your SMAIL - `config' file to the *domains=*-line an entry
     for *bitnet*, separated by a ":"

  8. If the packages installed properly, reload smail configuration.
     Now it should be possible to deliver mail within BITNET using nje.

Interfacing BSD-sendmail with FUNET-NJE
=======================================

   *This presentation is by the courtesy of mr.  Jukka Ukkonen of
CSC.FI, translation to english is by Matti Aarnio*

   Somewhere in the begin of the `sendmail.cf':
     # Bitnet route table (overriding default routes)
     Kbitnettable dbm -o /usr/local/lib/mail/bitnettable

   Then in *S0*-rules after error-mailer, local checkup, uucp, and
mailertable:
     # Try a separate table for bitnet routes.
     R$*<@$-.$+.bitnet.>$*       $:<$(bitnettable .$3$)>$1<$2.$3>$4
     R$*<@$+.bitnet.>$*          $:<$(bitnettable $2$)>$1<$2>$3
     R<$-!$-!$+>$*<$+>$*         $#$1$@$3$:$2          matched a 3 part route
     R<$-!$+>$*<$+>$*            $#$1$@$2$:$3@$4       matched a 2 part route

   One completely new ruleset, though a short one, because other domains
need not stripping:
     #
     #  Strip fake domains off in case posting directly
     #  to the receipient's native mail system.
     #
     S22
     R$*<@$+.bitnet.>       $@$1<@$2>

   This *R=22* is only for receiver's side mailer definitions.  (Odd
tens are for the sender, even tens are for the receiver.  Smaller ten
is for envelope conversion, and bigger is for header conversion in case
headers call for different transformation, than envelope, a'la S=11/31.)

   If sender address need to be translated into node format (from their
propable FQDN format), there appears a need for yet another mapping of
FQDN addresses to BITNET node names, which in practice means yet
another dbm-database for maintance:
       Kbitnetname dbm -o /usr/local/lib/mail/bitnetname
   This needs another set like `22' above which tries to do the lookup
according to the sender's machine, othervice the default *S=11* is ok.

   On the other hand those, who have *S=11/31*, like I have done it,
the `31' is dangerous, because it does a lookup of `*$(generics $1
$)*', which produces long names a'la *Jukka.Ukkonen*, which in the
usual BITNET-world is not quite commonly tolerated...

   A new *S=xx* could be for example this S=12 below.  `*$N*' can be
made local default name for the BITNET; *CNfinfiles*:

     S12
     R$*<@$=w.>     $:$1<@$(bitnetname $2$)>
     R$*<@$=w.>     $@$1<@$N>
     R$*<@$+.>      $@$1<@$(bitnetname $2$)>

   In addition to those there is also a need for all the mailer entries,
like: `*Mbsmtp3*'

   *Non-translated email continues with an apology of being too tired
to finish it "tonight", nor is `Jau' certain, that these make any
sense/are corrent - early September-94.*
             Cheers,
