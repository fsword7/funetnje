Many thanks for the useful comments on FUNETNJE. I will try the new code in
a few days. I hope to put the system into service in July to replace the IBM
(UKACRL). It all works very well and I am now working on automating the
updateing of tables and automatic house keeping (claering out dead mail and
producing statistics. I attach my sendmail.cf as requested. There is a
serious flaw that I have just found in that mail addressed to a nonexistant
user on the machine via NJE is not returned. I have not yet had time to
chase this fault. I have recently obtained PAROUTE and it compiled OK. I
will send you my version of file.cf and a script it calls, maketable.
maketable receives bitearn.nodes and produces the tables needed by sendamail
and funetnje. Both these are a bit primative - file.cf needs a bit more
security when I decide where bitearn.nodes will come from and maketable
needs a bit more checking that things have gone OK and to stop and restart
sendmail and funetnje cleanly to bring the new tables into use .(The three
files are concatinated and follow). I hope you find them useful and I would
appreceiate any suggestions for improvments or bug fixes.
Paul.
